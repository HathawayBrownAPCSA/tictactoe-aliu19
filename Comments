You still have items to do here ...

The Announce the Winner and the Check for a Tie
(You even commented on them in your code!)

However - you called this TicTacToe2 but in the main method you set up a TicTacToe[not 2] so it may be 
that you fixed the errors in there.

Good start here.  7/10 for now.
